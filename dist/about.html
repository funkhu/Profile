                <p>My 11 years in the IT industry has given me a strong foundation of technical skills and a
                    desire to always learn more. In addition to my Web Development skills, I also possess
                    great problem-solving skills, being able to thrive under stress and an ability to adapt and
                    learn. I am skilled with JavaScript, AngularJS, SQL, HTML and CSS. I have nearly 3
                    years’ experience using these skills in the working environment. In my off time I'm
                    always pushing to learn more, by doing additional courses. In addition to my Web
                    Development skills, I have a wealth of knowledge with Systems Support, from helping
                    users with learning a new system to setting up and maintaining servers. I always meet my
                    deadlines and enjoy the challenge, including working late and weekends to ensure a
                    smooth migration or to ensure an issue is fixed.</p>
